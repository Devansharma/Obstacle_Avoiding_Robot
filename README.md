# Obstacle_Avoiding_Robot

This is an arduino based project based on automation in which the robot moves and on detecting an obstacle it changes its path according to the situations that are present.

Components Used:
1) Arduino UNO as the controller
2) Ultrasonic Sensor for detecting the Obstacle
3) Motor Driver for controlling the motors.

This is an important project in the scope of the future due to the advancement int hte driverless cars. It can also become a life saver in conditions where normal human intervention can create troubles or harm to the human itself like in an area where the disaster has already happened or in a place of mishap for delivering materials for the people.

The current repository also consists of the project report created by the team
